This is a discord bot created using javascript that plays music in voice calls through using ffmpeg.
This bot was created because Youtube banned most music bots on discord from playing songs from Youtube links due to copy right so I created my own.
This bot was coded in discord.js v14 so if discord updates their api, the bot may not work.
The following node modules were installed for the bot to work:
npm install discord.js dotenv discord.js discord-player @discordjs/voice @discordjs/rest @discordjs/opus @discordjs/builders
